# fortune-generator
A lightweight program to filter fortune files to have a certain total length of strings, max number of lines, and other customizations.

This program will create a file which indexes all the fortunes in files so that they can be accessed randomly extremely fast and efficiently :D

## Why?
I want to have a random quote/sentence generator to generate a small text when I open my shell; however most collections of quotes out there can have long quotes/sentences that are not suitable for this purpose. This program allows me to filter out the quotes that are too long and only keep the ones that are suitable for this purpose.

Fortune files are separataed by a `%` on a new line, see example files
